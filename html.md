# HTML

## HTML: An Overview

**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It serves as the backbone of web content, allowing users to structure text, embed images, and create links.

### How HTML Works

HTML consists of a series of elements, each represented by tags enclosed in angled brackets such as `<html>`. These elements define the structure and content of a web page. For instance:

* **Headings**: `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags are used to create headings.
* **Paragraphs**: `<p>` tags define paragraphs.
* **Links**: `<a href="url">` creates hyperlinks to other resources.
* **Images**: `<img src="url" alt="description">` embeds images.

Browsers read HTML files and render them as web pages, interpreting the tags to display text, images, and other multimedia in a structured format.

### Uses of HTML

* **Web Page Design**: HTML is fundamental for creating web pages, providing the basic structure and layout.
* **Content Display**: It displays text, images, videos, and other multimedia elements.
* **Web Forms**: HTML supports form elements like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<button>` for collecting user data.

### Developments in HTML

Initially released in 1993, HTML has evolved significantly. The most current version, **HTML5**, introduces enhancements including:

* **Semantic Elements**: `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, and others allow for more meaningful structuring.
* **Multimedia Support**: Native audio `<audio>` and video `<video>` tags.
* **Offline Capabilities**: Features like local storage enable web applications to work offline.

HTML continues to be integral to web technology, adapting to new web development needs and influencing how information is presented on the internet.
